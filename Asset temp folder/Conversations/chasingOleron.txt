 :As the last mage falls, @main@ notices another person stumble out of the smoke.  It seems like the fire is finally spreading inside.
@main@:Roxanne!
roxanne:Milady?
@main@:How's the mana field?  Is the device destroyed yet?
roxanne:Not yet, we're still seeing a decrease.
@main@:We need something more destructive.
roxanne:An explosive spell?  That would take up most of the Illis we have left here.
@main@:Stop the firebombing, we're putting all our chips on this one.
roxanne:As you wish.
roxanne:Mages! Ready Devastation Wave!
 :The Mage Corps troops immediately switch scrolls and begin casting.
@main@:Aim for the atrium.  That's got to be the only room big enough to hold a machine that big.
roxanne:Fire!
 :The mages unleash their spell towards the largest room of the Guild.  Flaming debris shoots out in all directions as the shockwave hits.
@main@:Did that do it?
roxanne:Yes!  The dial is steady.  We did it!
 :There's a commotion as Jay can be seen leading a group of Inquisition soldier around to the back of the building.
@main@:What's going on over there?
 :Her question is suddenly answered as a horse-drawn wagon comes barreling past them.
@main@:This can't be good.

@main@:Jay!  Report!
jay:It's Rutledge!  He's got something in the back of the -
 :His response is abruptly cut off as the world goes white for a second.  @main@ loses all hearing.
 :She turns around to see a secondary explosion rising from the rubble of where they destroyed the device.  The lighning mixed in signals it was a magical explosion.
@main@:Augh!
@main@:Was that the device exploding?
roxanne:It must have been.
jay:Listen!  Rutledge is getting away and he's got something on the back of that wagon of his!
roxanne:Another device?  Or maybe part of one.
@main@:I'm going after him.
roxanne:How?  He's on horseback and there's a sea of flames between us and him!
@main@:We can't let him get away.
jay:Agreed, but I don't see a way we can reach him in all this chaos.
@main@:There's always a way.
roxanne:We shouldn't overextend our forces.  Rutledge is one just one man and we can stop the rest of the guild if we stay focused.
@main@:That may be true, but let's not forget our main objective.  I don't know how that device works, but we can't let him do whatever it is he does with it that is draining the rest of the mana field.
roxanne:I know, but he's as good as gone now.  We can hold the line in against the rest of the guild as is, but not if we have to chase Rutledge down too.
jay:Unfortunately, I agree with Roxanne's assessment.  It is, however, irrelevant given we won't be able to catch up to him today.  When the situation calms down slightly here, I will personally ride and hunt Rutledge down.
@main@:I can think of one way to catch up to him...
roxanne:We agreed - no more portals.
jay:Isn't that a bad idea?
@main@:Yes, but we don't have the time.  If Rutledge reactivates the device, I don't think magic will be long for this world.
roxanne:A portal would cause the same result.
jay:Is this a "damned if we do, damned if we don't" situation?
@main@:Not necessarily.  Look.  Either we do nothing and Rutledge causes the end of magic, or we take a risk and have a chance of saving the world.  I think the choice is pretty obvious.
jay:Assuming Rutledge is hellbent on activating the device as soon as possible.
@main@:He escaped the guild hall with literally nothing else.  Obviously it's his priority number one.  Roxanne, get a couple mages.
roxanne:As you wish, milady.
jay:I hope this works.
@main@:So do I.

 :Roxanne flags down 4 mages from their formation.  After a quick conversation, they start casting in front of the group.
roxanne:These are the guys Taney had make the portals to the city during their invasion.
@main@:Good.  We'll need to cut Rutledge off somewhere.
jay:The best location would be the south side of the harbor.  Either he's leaving the city by boat or has some plan to get out past the north side of the city.  Both routes take him past the south side harbor.
roxanne:You heard the man.  Put the exit at the harbor.
 :The mage nearest to her nods, and soon a hole in reality begins to form.
roxanne:You feel that?  We're close to losing it all.
@main@:Not if I have anything to say about it - Look!  There he is!
 :As the portal expands, Rutledge's wagon can be seen coming into view.
@main@:I'm going in.
 :@main@ dashes through, simultaneously casting a spell at the wagon.
 :With an explosion, Rutledge is forced to stop as his damaged wagon skids against the ground.
@main@:You are guilty of crimes against the Inquisition.  Cease and we will spare you!
Rutledge:I will never surrender to some madwoman like you!

 :After a brutal fight, a visibly weakened Rutledge falls to the ground.  Both parties are drained.
rutledge:Why?  I'm trying to save us...
@main@:So am I.
 :All of a sudden, a loud crunch sounds as the portal behind @main@ collapses in a deafening explosion.
@main@:Aaaaaggh!

@main@:What...  was that?
 :She looks up to see the light of the device on the wagon's back fade away.  @main@ stumbles to her feet.
@main@:Uuuugh...
 :@main@ attempts to cast a spell.  Any spell.  Or just channel mana.  Anything to show there's still magic in the world.
@main@:No...
 :It is futile.  No indication of the extranormal appears.
rutledge:Uuuugh....
@main@:You...
 :She hobbles towards the form of the fallen man.
@main@:...will pay for what you have done here.
 :Her strength restored by rage, @main@ smashes her staff into Rutledge's stomach.
rutledge:Aaaaah!  Why?  I-
@main@:Shut up!  If only I could have been faster...
 :As @main@ strikes again, she sees how frail the old man is.
rutledge:Uaaagh!
 :His body curls up instinctively.
@main@:All I've done... just for you come in and make it all meaningless!?
 :She braces her staff against Rutledge's throat and pushes. He gasps for breath, but finds none.  
 :@main@ watches as his thrashing grows slower.  Slower.
 :Nothing.
 :
@main@:It's over.
 :Reality reasserts itself, and @main@'s weakness returns.  As she collapses into unconciousness, her final glimpse of the world is of her compatriots rushing to her side.
