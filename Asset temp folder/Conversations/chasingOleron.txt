 :As the last mage falls, @main@ notices another person stumble out of the smoke.  It seems like the fire is finally spreading inside.
@main@:Roxanne!
roxanne:Milady?
@main@:How's the mana field?  Is the device destroyed yet?
roxanne:Not yet, we're still seeing a decrease.
@main@:We need something more destructive.
roxanne:An explosive spell?  That would take up most of the Illis we have left here.
@main@:Stop the firebombing, we're putting all our chips on this one.
roxanne:As you wish.
roxanne:Mages! Ready Devastation Wave!
 :The Mage Corps troops immediately switch scrolls and begin casting.
@main@:Aim for the atrium.  That's got to be the only room big enough to hold a machine that big.
roxanne:Fire!
 :The mages unleash their spell towards the largest room of the Guild.  Flaming debris shoots out in all directions as the shockwave hits.
@main@:Did that do it?
roxanne:Yes!  The dial is steady.  We did it!
 :There's a commotion as Jay can be seen leading a group of Inquisition soldier around to the back of the building.
@main@:What's going on over there?
 :Her question is suddenly answered as a horse-drawn wagon comes barreling past them.
@main@:This can't be good.

@main@:Jay!  Report!
jay:It's Oleron!  He's got something in the back of the -
 :His response is abruptly cut off as the world goes white for a second, and @main@ loses all hearing.
 :She turns around to see a secondary explosion rising from the rubble of where they destroyed the device.  The lighning mixed in signals it was a magical explosion.
@main@:Augh.
@main@:Was that the device exploding?
roxanne:It must have been.
jay:Listen!  Oleron is getting away and he's got something on the back of that wagon of his!
roxanne:Another device?  Or part of one.
@main@:I'm going after him.
roxanne:How?  He's on horseback!
@main@:You there!  Citizen!
 :A man is trying to get a hold of his horse as they were clearly startled by the explosion.
@main@:In the name of the Inquisition and the nobility, relinquish your horse!
citizen:Are you crazy?  No - Augh!
 :@main@ doesn't let him finish, unleashing a spell from her staff and taking the reins as his body slumps off.
roxanne:I see...

 :@main@ follows the path Oleron took, her lack of cargo allowing her to catch up.
@main@:Oleron!  In the name of the Inquisition, Cease!
Oleron:Not to s madwoman like you!
@main@:Damn it!  Cease and I may spare you!

 :After a brutal fight, a visibly weakened Oleron loses control of his horses.  The side of his wagon hits the side of a building, breaking something structural.
 :The cart collapses as the horses run off, no longer restrained.  @main@ dismounts to view the wreckage and a dying Oleron.
oleron:Why?  I was trying to save us...
@main@:So am I.  What is this you took with you?
 :@main@ moves closer to inspect what is clearly a magical device.
oleron:It's... the core...
@main@:Of the device we blew up?
oleron:Yes... When it became unstable, we had to... get it to safe...ty.
@main@:Why would you build this?
oleron:We needed... to fuel... the Source...
 :A light starts emitting from the damaged device.  It start vibrating.
@main@:What's happening?  What it doing?
oleron:What it was... designed to do...
@main@:Channel mana?  Uh oh.
 :The device starts glowing brighter and brighter.
@main@:Take this!
 :She attempts to cast a spell, but nothing happens.
@main@:Its already drained all the mana in the area... No... Nooooo!
 :She attempts to get close to the device, but is driven back by a burning sensation.
@main@:Nooooooo!
 :The device begins to shake itself to pieces until... Nothing.
 :...
@main@:What... happened?  I can't feel...
 :Her hands move to her face.  She feels nothing until a sharp pain indicates she has been badly burned.
@main@:Aaaaaah!
 :She surveys what she can from the ground.  Oleron is there, clearly dead.  What remains of the device sits in front of her.
@main@:Please work...
 :@main@ attempts to cast the most basic light spell, but when she goes to channel the mana, there is no response.
@main@:No...  All of... my work...
@main@:Just to... fail?
 :As collapses once more into unconciousness, her last sensation is of her compatriots rushing to her side.
