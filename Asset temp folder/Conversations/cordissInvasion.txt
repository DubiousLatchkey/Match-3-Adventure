@main@:Who are those people outside?
catelia:I don't know, but it looks like they're all around the castle.
@main@:Look!  There's an army in front of the castle!
myra:I think I can see seige equipment.  This isn't good.
@main@:Whose flag is that?
myra:Hmm, that standard has a yellow cross on red.  Looks like it's from The City.  Only Duke Cordiss could be bearing the flag of the Themata of Constance City.
catelia:Wait, we're a Themata?  I thought Themata were large regions of the empire, not just one city.
gabriella:Normally yes, but The City is important enough to be governed separately.
@main@:Regardless, what are they doing here?
myra:Your guess is as good as mine, but it looks like the Duke has come here to claim Castle Blair for himself.
catelia:Can he just do that?
gabriella:Well, technically, as a Duke, the land is already his.
myra:Now hang on, if we're being technical, this land isn't his.  It belonged to Marquess Blair until Atheria took it over.
catelia:Semantics.
@main@:Even if we don't technically own any of this land, we do control it.  Surely that's got to count for something.
myra:We control this land by right of conquest?  Yeah, I think his buddies in the House of Lords would rule against us there.  Gabby and I are the only ones here of noble descent, and none of our families' lands are even near here.
catelia:I don't think we can just give this whole place up.
@main@:If we give up the castle, we're giving up a lot of potential for power projection.  Without it we'd have no way to even bargain for a reduction in magic use.
gabriella:Whether we "legitimately" own this place or not, we can do a lot of good here.  I hope the Duke can see that.
myra:Our ideas are unsanctioned by the Guild and he's here with trebuchets.  I don't think this is going to be a peaceful interaction.
catelia:Look!  Someone's coming out from the formation!  I think they mean to speak with us.
@main@:Shoot.  This isn't good.  Cat, find Roxanne.  Tell her to start peparing the castle defenses.
catelia:Got it.

knight:Presenting his Lordship Duke Cordiss!
cordiss:You there, are you @main@?
@main@:I am.  To what do I owe the pleasure?
cordiss:You see @main@, I hope to end this without bloodshed.  I'd hate to have to have to destroy this place before giving it back to it's rightful owner.
@main@:Its rightful owner?
cordiss:Yes, Marquess Blair has been without his castle for many years now, but these lands are still his.  I ask you to surrender this castle in the name of the Empire.
@main@:I'm afraid we can't do that.  Our mission here is too important.
cordiss:Yes, I've heard of it.  To be honest, I don't understand your magic theory nonsense, and I don't care.  Marquess Blair requests his property back, and you have no claim to it.
@main@:...
cordiss:Oh yes, and that means all of his property.  You think you can just steal his slaves and just get away with it?  No.  I am here to restore order to this region, and if you will not make this easy for me, I will have to begin firing.
@main@:He owned that mine?  Never mind that - slavery is wrong, and we will fight here for their lives and freedom.
cordiss:So be it.
 :He gestures to the knight on his right who begins blowing on a horn.
@main@:Alright, ring the bell for castle defense, we've got to break this seige!
 :A dinging sound can be heard echoing through the castle.
@main@:Looks like Catelia found Roxanne.  Let's get to work people!

###Fighting people on castle wall###

@main@:Roxanne!  There you are.  What's our status?
roxanne:Not great.  We've repelled the initial wave, but by the way they're pulling back it looks like they're about to start hitting us with their trebuchets now.
@main@:How did they get all this here so quickly?
roxanne:Well, I don't think there are that many soldiers here.  I talked to the guys on watch last night, and they said most of the people here in the morning were seige engineers putting the trebuchets together.
@main@:Why would they do that?
myra:From what I'm hearing, it sounds like Cordiss really hoped to scare us into handing the castle over.  I mean think about it - it would be impossible to mobilize a large army in the time since we freed that slave camp and bring them all here.
@main@:He did say he's doing this for Marquess Blair - maybe this is just a favor to him, not an invasion.
roxanne:Ok, then what do we do about it?
 :A crash rumbles through the castle.
roxanne:He's still got his personal forces and those trebuchets aren't just for show.
@main@:Right, we'll have to get a force close enough to destroy them.
roxanne:No way are we going to just open the gates and run forward.  His forces still outnumber us, even if it is only slightly.
@main@:We need another way around.  If we can flank his forces, I'm sure we can destroy the trebuchets.
roxanne:Atheria would open a portal.
myra:That could work -
@main@:No!  We all know how harmful that is to the mana field.  
roxanne:You'd rather die here?
@main@:Look, only if we have no other option.  Is there any way we could sneak out of here and into a favorable position?
roxanne:...
myra:Don't castles usually have tunnels leading out?
roxanne:I know there is one here, but it won't put you behind them.  A portal would be so much easier -
@main@:Where will it put us?
roxanne:I think it opens up somewhere to the side of where they are now.
@main@:Not optimal, but I think it's enough.
myra:Are you sure?
@main@:Yes.  Let's do this.

@main@:Alright, the moment we open this door, we charge the trebuchets.  Roxanne, you go for the one on the left, and I'll go for the one on the right.
roxanne:It isn't too late to do the portal idea.
@main@:I said no, and that's final.  We don't have time to debate this.
catelia:Actually, how much time do we have before they bring down the walls?
roxanne:I don't know.  I'm not a seige engineer.
@main@:Any guesses?
myra:I've heard of seiges that lasted a long time.  I don't know how that applies here though, but it should be at least on the order of days.
@main@:Are you willing to bet on that?
myra:No.
@main@:Then let's go.  Are we ready?
gabriella:Ready.
myra:Ready.
catelia:Ready.
roxanne:Fine.  I'm ready.
