@main@:Uhhhh... How exactly do the House of Lords proceedings work?
rehnquist:Let me handle that.  If there is pressure for you to speak, remind them that your Imperial legitimacy trumps Marquess Blair - sorry - the commoner John Blair's.
rehnquist:Oh that does feel good to say. "The commoner John Blair"
@main@:Where do I sit?
rehnquist:Just sit next to me.  
|enter sergeant-at-arms
rehnquist:Ah Sergeant, your staff
 :She hands him an staff decorated with a double-headed eagle
sergeant-at-arms:Thank you, your Grace.
@main@:What was that?
rehnquist:The Staff of Parliment.  Technically, we all serve at the behest of Her Majesty the Empress, and her staff is used in lieu of herself being here to be a symbol of her authority.
@main@:But why do you have it?
rehnquist:Let's just say it took some convincing for the Empress to give me her personal staff.  I like to do this little charade of handing it to the sergeant before we enter the House Chambers to remind everyone else here of who's really in charge.
@main@:I... see.
rehnquist:Make sure your vassals are sitting on my side when we enter.
@main@:Yes, your Grace.
|transition houseOfLords
 :Slowly, the lords of the 33 themata of the Southern Empire enter the chamber of the House of Lords.
speaker:The first to speak today is Duke Cordiss.
cordiss:Milords, I stand to ask the question laid before you on the order paper.
clerk:Milords, the usurpation of Marquess Blair's peerage is an abomination, and the houseless @main@ must be removed from her position, and the themata of Thracia be returned to the control of John Blair.
cordiss:Milords, why are we all here?  We are here because we are the best of our society.  The leaders and landholders who must work together to secure the empire's future.
cordiss:The nature of our births, education, lands, and the grace of Her Majesty the Empress give us authority over the commonfolk who are unable to see from our priviledged positions.
cordiss' lords:Hear, hear!
cordiss:Why is is then, that an established, well educated, lord of this house, and my personal friend, the right, noble Marquess Blair's rightful seat in this chamber be taken from him?
cordiss:If it is such that such noble qualities imbue one with authority, then this imposter -
 :He glares directly at @main@.
cordiss: -must be removed under the authority of this house, and the true Marquess Blair's lands restored.
blair:Milords, the noble Duke speaks truth.  When my castle was forcibly taken by hostile forces, I retained my noble dignity.  When I returned to this chamber to ask for aid, I did so as a Marquess of the Empire.
blair:When the army to reclaim my lands was repelled, I retained my title, my nobility, and my honor.  Yes, it has been years since then, but I remain the rightful lord of Thracia.
rehnquist:Milords, the opposition makes many points as to the legitimacy of the noble Marchioness Blair, yet they continue to refer to John Blair as "Marquess".  As a point of order, noble lords of this House should refer to the Marchioness Blair with the respect befitting of her position and to John as the commoner Her Majesty has recognized him as.
speaker:Point of order sustained.
blatchford:Milords, this whole proceeding is a farce.  Duchess Rehnquist is clearly mocking us with this point of order.  The noble Duke Cordiss deserves to speak to his side of the argument and not be effectively censured by the Lord Speaker.
ellsworth:Milords, that is a blatant misrepresentation of the situation.  Must I remind the noble Earl Blatchford that our titles are derived from the power of her Imperial Majesty, Empress Nyala?  If we do not acknowledge who she has given peerage, we are undermining her authority.
rehnquist's lords:Hear, hear!
@main@:Who's this coming to our defense?
rehnquist:That's Marchioness Ellsworth.  She manages a good portion of my forces, and everyone sitting on this side of the house will be defending your right to rule today.
@main@:Wow.
blatchford:Milords, we are not undermining the authority of Her Majesty.  The purpose of this chamber is to question and assist in the execution of government of Her Majesty, and we cannot do that effectively unless we can refer to John Blair by his imperial title.
cordiss:Enough.  Milords, the fact that the supposed Marchioness Blair has not spoken to her own defense proves she is a puppet of Duchess Rehnquist.  We are nobility, and should be recognized as such.  There is no place among us for weak, poor spoken commoners.
 :@main@ glances over to the Duchess who nods her head slightly.
@main@:Milords, such accusations are outrageous.  I am recognized by Her Majesty the Empress, and the noble lords of this house have full knowledge of that.  I am no weak commoner.  In fact, if anyone here today is weak, it is John Blair himself.  The noble Duke Cordiss was correct.  We are nobles, and deserve to be recognized as such.
@main@:John Blair was the one who lost his castle to mere bandits.  John Blair is the one who is here today only by his imagined authority over the lands I have controlled and defended.  By right of conquest and Her Majesty's blessing, I am the rightful lord of Thracia.
rehnquist's lords:Hear, hear!
cordiss:And what of your subjects?  Milords, who do Blair's vassals swear their loyalties to?
iredell:Milords, we serve the noble Marchioness @main@ Blair.
rehnquist:Perhaps the news did not reach the City of Constants yet Duke Cordiss?
 :Cordiss fumes silently as he realizes his mistake.
 :Debate in the House of Lords continues until the time to vote approaches.
speaker:The question being now put, those in favor say "content" -
cordiss' lords:Content!
speaker:Those opposed say "not content" -
rehnquist's lords:Not content!
speaker:Clear the bar and begin voting procedures.
 :One by one, scribes bring paper votes from each lord to the center of the chambers where clerks count the votes.
speaker:The question is that the motion be agreed to.  Milords have voted.  There are 34 who say content, and 35 who say not content.  The not contents have it.
@main@:*Exhales* Well, that was very tense.
rehnquist:Please.  The debate is just a formality.  In truth, this matter was settled as soon as I deemed it so.  That's how it goes with a majority in the House and control over the Empress.
