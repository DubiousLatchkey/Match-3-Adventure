jay:Milady, do you feel well?
@main@:No, but what is it.
jay:We've taken the Guild.  We'll try to put it back together starting tomorrow.
@main@:That's... good.  I... need to be alone right now.
jay:I understand, milady.

 :@main@ contemplates in her bed as Jay stands outside.
 :She cries, but is interrupted by a noise from outside.
 :Someone bangs at the door.  Their voices, although muffled, are heard inside.
jay:What are you doing!  I told you she is not to be disturbed!
roxanne:She needs to see this!
jay:Can't it wait until tomorrow's meeting?
roxanne:Look!
 :There is a silence.
jay:Milady, you need to see this.
 :@main@ dries her eyes and steps outside.
@main@:What!
roxanne:Look!
 :She holds forth a mana field detector.  In an instant, the gravity of the situation dawns on @main@ as she sees the needle visibly dropping.
@main@:Fetch the others.  Now.

catelia:What's the big idea people?  I was in the middle of debriefing some of the soldiers!
 :Her eyes fall on the table to see the device.
catelia:Not again!
jay:Again?
myra:The last time we saw this happen, it was when Atheria opened her portals to invade the city.
roxanne:Portals take a lot of mana to channel, but we're the only ones who know how to make them.
myra:I can't think of anything else that could cause this... what about you roxanne?  You're the mana field theory expert here.
roxanne:Besides portals, there are some experimental things we tried that could do this, but they're esoteric enough to be out of the question.
catelia:Isn't the answer simple?  Someone is channelling a butt-ton of mana.
@main@:We can do the same thing we did then - locate the source.  That should narrow things down at least.
myra:Right, Jay, can you hand me that detector over there?
jay:Uh sure.
myra:Roxanne, hold the other one.
roxanne:Ah, I see what you're doing.
myra:Ok, the field is clearly stronger on Roxanne's than on mine.  The source of this is coming from this side of the room... which is...
catelia:North.  It looks like its a little to the west too.
myra:Ok, what's in that direction.  Obviously The City -
@main@:It's the Mage's Guild.
roxanne:That makes sense, but what could they possibly be doing there?
myra:I have no idea.
@main@:Well I'm not sitting here and waiting to find out.  We need to get to The City, and we need to get there now.
roxanne:You know, the portal we opened to the north side of the City was never closed...
@main@:That's amazing.  We should probably get the Inquisition ready too.
catelia:And I had just sent a bunch of them to the barracks...  I'll muster who I can, and we'll meet you on the other side.
jay:We're still missing a part of the plan.  What are we going to do once we get to The City?
@main@:I'm going to talk to Duke Cordiss.  I suspect he might know something.
myra:Really? Why?
@main@:Last time I talked to him, he said Oleron was also worried about the end of magic, but from the perspective of internalized mana theory.
myra:Hmmm...
