@main@:All things considered, that went pretty well I think.
roxanne:We have oaths of loyalty from all the lords except Lady Iredell, I wish we could have the additional income from the tax collection -
jay:No.
roxanne:Yeah, that appears to be unpopular.  Regardless we will have to transfer their next payments to Duchess Rehnquist, who is still expecting a profit.
myra:Can we make up the difference by taxing our own lands higher?
roxanne:In theory, yes, but a lot of our subjects here very much like their low tax rate.  Some of them moved here to avoid imperial taxes, so I don't think that will be very popular.
jay:I've taken stock of your forces, milady, and we do not have enough men to both pacify our population and project power elsewhere.
roxanne:As much as I hate to say it, and hate hearing it, he's right.
gabriella:Well, with the land we're giving out to the former slaves, shouldn't we have more income from their taxes?
@main@:It will take some time for them to get settled and start producing effectively.  It may take months for farmers.
roxanne:Our next collection period isn't for half year, but we could change it - say it's because of our new imperial duties.
jay:That's not very fair to the people.
myra:When does the next legal term start?
jay:2 months-ish.
@main@:Ah, right, I'll have to hold court during those times, right?
roxanne:Don't worry about that, the local towns are pretty good at dealing with this themselves.  You should probably just recognize the local courts as imperial ones now, with you being the final arbiter.
jay:This is why we need reform.  We can't just arbitarily hold court sometimes and not at others.  If I were in charge -
catelia:Hang on, I'm confused.  I always paid my taxes before the Feast of Angels each year.
jay:Every collector and lord handles it differently.  Countess Iredell always paid her share to the House of Blair during the Festival of Rebirth, not the Feast of Angels.  When did you say you collect now?
roxanne:We generally send our collector out near the end of the year to get the money by the beginning of the next.
jay:A logical choice of date.
gabriella:Well, according to my father, Lady Rehnquist collects her tax money before the Feast of Angels.
@main@:So we've got 3 months to scrounge up enough money to pay her, we still have to pacify Countess Iredell, and avoid channelling enough mana to destroy the mana field.  Got it.
gabriella:It's a lot of responsibility, but I think we're up to it.
catelia:Well if we need to make money, what about the mine we took over?
myra:Progress is slow.  The mine is back up and running, but we're still working on reducing the amount of charged Illis we neeed to buy.
jay:Sorry, how does that affect anything?
myra:If we need more charged Illis, we need to employ a charging service which channels mana into the crystals thus putting strain on the mana field.
jay:Er, as you say.
myra:The main problem we have is actually selling the stuff.  It seems like that was handled by the slavemasters that we drove out.
catelia:I should be able to help with that.  I know the Illis industry.  I'm a little further along the supply chain, but I know the rates for this type of stuff and the people who would buy it.
@main@:Excellent.  Cat, if you can help Myra, we'll be golden.  Or in this case - purple.
catelia:Ha.
myra:Hang on.  According to the cash flow tables in the mine, we'll only be able to pay the difference the Duchess wants if we reach their old output at their old efficiency.  Seeing as we lost many people who came to be citizens here and are going to be minimizing mana use, that's not going to happen.
@main@:Hmm...  So if we want to keep taxing at our current rate, we'll have to find another source of income.  Let's see if we can't hit two birds with one stone.
gabriella:You have a plan?
@main@:Maybe.  If we were to invade Iredell's castle, wouldn't we be able to take her gold?
jay:As reparations and as punishment?  I believe that would be in order.
roxanne:Yeah, but it's not going to engender any long term relationships and you may make some lifetime enemies.  I'd assume you'd like to keep her lands profitable and compliant over dead.
gabriella:It's also less cruel to not seize all her assets.
roxanne:Regardless of to what extent we can push Lady Iredell, we currently don't have the forces to take her on in her castle.
@main@:We'll have to whittle her down a litle first.  Where does she get her forces from?
jay:Most of her manpower comes from her vassal baronies, and as an Illis refiner, she makes her own magical weapons.
@main@:Anything we can exploit?
jay:Well, after you took over her main source of Illis, she was forced to turn elsewhere to less... officical sources.  I believe she contracted out the local Exchange to fill the gap.
catelia:Well What do you know?
jay:Have you dealt with the Exchange before?
gabriella:You could say that.
@main@:That sounds like a good target.  No one is going to complain about a crackdown on criminals, and we disrupt Iredell's supply of Illis while confiscating their gold.
myra:And assets.  Doesn't the Exchange deal in slaves as well?
jay:Yes.  This is a good opportunity to find these people some decent work under us.
myra:The mine could use some more able hands.  I'd imagine our army would appreciate some as well.
jay:Milady, I would request more time to train any slaves willing to join our army.  The average freed slave may want to fight harder than a conscripted peasant, but a well-trained army will defeat them any day of the week.
 :Roxanne looks as if she's about to object, but contains herself.
@main@:Do you have something to say Roxanne?
roxanne:It's just that as much as I appreciate Sir Jay's experience, we, the formerly Atherian forces, have been doing this for a long time now.  The power of our army should not go to an... outsider.
@main@:He isn't an outsider - he's one of us now.
jay:I understand the concern, but she brings up a valid point - our responsibilities have not been well defined.
myra:As stakeholders, we're all responsible for making sure the Death of Magic doesn't come.  I would say we all think about what's needed and serve the way we think is best.
gabriella:Yeah, we're all friends here!  I don't think we need to worry that much about who's responsible for what exactly.
catelia:I don't know, even my city watch had a clear hierarchy.
jay:As much as I'm against social hierarchies, they are necessary in order to run an organized military.
roxanne:On that, you and I can agree, Jay.  I think the issue lies as to how we are going to distribute our resources.
@main@:Ok then.  First of all, I consider everyone in this room here to be equal when we stand around this table. Secondly, if we have to divide power for our military arm... hmm...
@main@:Roxanne, you can keep the command structure we have now with the mages and control over whatever forces Atheria had before.  Jay, take command of our new volunteer force.  If we free more people from the Exchange's camp, divide them between yourselves.
myra:Separate branches equal in standing?
@main@:Look, the idea is you each have your own forces, but they can collaborate with each other.  We want the advantages of a structured military, but we don't want the Atherian mages to think we're cannibalizing them.
@main@:Anyways, where were we?
catelia:Taking down the Exchange again.
@main@:Right.  Jay, do you know where they're set up?
jay:My former lady always sent the expeditions to pick up the Illis to the woods to the south of the castle.  I have an approximate location, but we should scout it out first.
roxanne:We're on it.
catelia:Nice.  Once they're done we can really stick it to the Exchange - hopefully for good!
