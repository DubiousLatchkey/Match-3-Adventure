jay:Hey Roxanne.
roxanne:Is this about the supplies for the horses? I just talked with the stablehands about it.  We should be good to go.
jay:Oh, good.
jay:...
roxanne:Something you want to say?
jay:It's just...  I heard about how you met @main@.
roxanne:And?
jay:Well, you were questioning my loyalties because I betrayed my lord, yet, from what I hear, you did something similar.  After Atheria died, you immediately joined with @main@.
roxanne:That's completely different.  Atheria was dead, and I had to act quickly for the safety of our organization which would have been headed swiftly to the noose.
jay:Yes, but you also sided with someone your "lord", well boss I guess, opposed.
roxanne:You wouldn't understand.
jay:Is that what I sounded like?
roxanne:*sigh*  I will do what I have to in order to stop the end of magic from coming.  You're a knight with connections to noble families. I'm no one.  If the end of magic comes, you'll still be living easy, but I'll be missing an arm.  
jay:Ah, right.  It needs magic to work.
roxanne:It doesn't "need magic to work".  It's little more than a few pieces of metal stuck together.  I have to use my mana to animate it continuously.  If I have to abandon my previous master to keep this semblance of functionality, I will.
jay:Sorry.  I didn't know.  So all you want is to stop the end of magic?
roxanne:Yes.
jay:What about afterward?
roxanne:Afterward?  After what?
jay:After we stop the end from coming.  I mean we can't be doing this forever.
roxanne:Magic use will always exist, and thus will always need to be regulated.
jay:Yeah, but at some point, we will have brought this whole crisis to an end.  Look at our progress so far!  Once the problem is under control, what will you do?
roxanne:...I don't know.  What are you going to do?
jay:Well, I guess I'll still work with @main@ to make the Empire a better place for the little people.
roxanne:Right, because that's why your here now.
roxanne:You know... that doesn't sound so bad.
jay:Are you agreeing with me?
roxanne:Maybe...  I guess I haven't really thought about it.
