jay:...Yes?
roxanne:I don't trust you.
jay:What a coincidence.  I don't trust you either.
jay:Is that all you came here to say?
roxanne:Why are you here?
jay:Because I thought I'd take a walk?
roxanne:You think that's what I was asking?
jay:Didn't @main@ explain this already?
roxanne:And?  You have nothing more to add?
jay:Where are you going with this?
roxanne:I just find it particularly interesting you would so easily abandon your lord to serve Lady @main@.  That doesn't seem to bode well for our turnover rate.
jay:Well the title of Marchioness trumps that of Countess doesn't it?
roxanne:You damn well know that's not a real answer.  You wouldn't go running to a superior lord until your own has been defeated.  No one I've ever seen has done what you're doing.
jay:Psh.  Someone like you wouldn't understand.
roxanne:Oh really?  And what's that supposed to mean?
jay:I fight for change.  You know there are only a privileged few of us with the opportunity to leave a mark on the world.  I intend to leave it better than I left it.
roxanne:That's it?
jay:I told you you wouldn't understand.  The Empire is full of injustices - most people don't get enough education to know their being oppressed.  Let's not even get started on the whole institution of slavery.
roxanne:That's pretty elitist.  "Only you can fix everything?"  Please.
jay:Call it what you want.  I put the people first.  People like you just seize what power you can.  You know, you're a victim of the system too.  There is no way for most people to improve their lives in meaningful way, so violence is the only solution.  
roxanne:People like me?  Jay, you're only arguing against yourself.  Your loyalty to these nebulous ideas does not make me think you won't betray us the same way you did Countess Iredell.
jay:We need reform.  @main@, a commoner with no family ties, getting a Marquessate is biggest positive social move I've ever seen.  Her move against the slavers in Mirren was the most significant abolitionist action taken in years.  So no, I don't think I'm going to betray @main@ anytime soon.
roxanne:I'll have you know I organized that raid.
jay:...Well, then thank you for your contribution.
roxanne:...Perhaps we are on the same side.
