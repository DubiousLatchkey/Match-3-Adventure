catelia:Perimeter secured, @main@.
jay:The main force is ready.
@main@:Begin the assault!

### fights here ###

duvall:Are you mad @main@?  What are you doing!
@main@:Weren't you the one who dared me to attack you?
duvall:I didn't think you'd actually do it!  Insane!  The history you are destroying here stretches since before the Empire!
@main@:Yeah, yeah.  If you really cared so much, you would have submitted to my authority.
duvall:Over my dead body.
@main@:That's the idea.

### fight with Duvall ###

duvall:Augh!
 :He falls to the ground, dead.
gabriella:No!  Father!
@main@:It's over, Gabby.  We don't have to fight.
gabriella:We don't have to fight!?  You come here, kill my father, and say we don't have to fight?  You understand nothing.
@main@:There's been enough death today.  I don't want to fight you.
@main@:Look.  We've taken over the building.  There's no point in fighting anymore.  We can work together again!
gabriella:I can't believe you @main@.  I always knew you were ambitious, but I can't believe you would go this far.
@main@:You know my "ambitions" are to save the world.
gabriella:As everyone's are.  I think I understand what Countess Iredell, Marchioness Ellsworth, and Duke Cordiss all felt.
@main@:What do you mean?
gabriella:The feeling when someone takes everything that matters to you, and then asks for your help.  Maybe some of them felt differently, but I, for one, can't believe your arrogance.
@main@:Don't do this Gabby.  Don't you believe in our cause?
gabriella:I have no choice Marchioness Blair.  You killed my father, prepare to die.
@main@:Then you have chosen your fate, Lady Duvall.

### fight with Gabriella ###

gabriella:Ah!
 :Gabriella falls to the ground, her wounds mortal.
gabriella:Was I still... holding back?
@main@:It didn't have to be this way...
gabriella:Heh.  You might... be able to fight without mercy... but clearly... I can't...
gabriella:Ah...
 :Gabriella's final breath is exhaled as a tear rolls down @main@'s cheeck.
soldier:Milady, the building is secure.  I see you've handled the Baron.
@main@:I suppose I have...
soldier:Milady?
@main@:It's nothing.  Deliver the news to Jay.  He'll give you your next orders.
soldier:As you wish, milady.
