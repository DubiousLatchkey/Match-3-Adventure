@main@:So our first order of business is what to do about my, uh, new vassals.
roxanne:I'll begin mobilizing our forces.
gabriella:Wait!  We should try and negotiate first.  We can't just invade whoever we want all the time!
jay:Actually, given that they are our vassals, we have every right to assert our control.
catelia:And here I was thinking you were against hereditary rule.
jay:I am, but that doesn't mean I'm not well versed in what would make us appear legitimate in this position.
catelia:Well we're agreed there.  If what Jay said about Countess Iredell is right, I doubt she's just going to stop mobilizing if we ask her to.
gabriella:That doesn't mean we shoudn't try.
myra:Agreed.  If we have a meeting with all of the lords in Thracia, we'll be able to at least figure out who's going to be a problem.  Um, how many of them are there by the way?
roxanne:I have a list somewhere of the lords in Thracia.  Many of them have tried to take this castle for themselves over the years.  The important ones are those that can vote in the House of Lords.  If we sway them, that should satisfy Lady Rehnquist.
jay:I know them.  There are 3 Earls and Countesses in the Themata that vote in the House of Lords.  Lady Iredell is among them.
@main@:Alright then, we need an approach to deal with each of them, and the lords as a whole.
jay:It would be customary to impose some sort of tribute from each one.  The lords not bearing gifts at this meeting are going to be the ones we'll have to convince.
gabriella:Hopefully we can use the carrot and not the stick here right?  What are they paying now?
myra:I'm not sure, do you have an idea Jay?
jay:Well, since the former lord Blair was usurped by Atheria, Duke Cordiss took direct control over what are now our vassals.  He is the quintessence of noble excess, and demands taxes at a rate in excess to that of the Imperial rate.
@main@:Ok, that's good, at least for us.  If we collect at the Imperial rate or less, they should be much more receptive to our rule.
catelia:Man we're going to be collecting taxes now?  Geez.
roxanne:We have already been taxing the lands around here, but at a much lower rate, and for our personal use.  You can imagine why we weren't paying the Empress.
jay:The whole system of lower lords paying taxes to the next level above them is so disgusting.  At each layer, more is demanded so the middlemen can make a profit.
catelia:Is that how it works?
jay:Yes.  At least for now.  If I were in charge, I would make the Imprial government collect from all individually, this way -
roxanne:Besides the point.  Look, if we have to pay the Imperial property tax now, we're going to need the money from our vassal lords.  I'll have to talk to our accountant about also changing what we collect locally and paying what we're due to the Duchess.
@main@:I'm sure Lady Rehnquist will be willing to help us on that.  Send him to the capital to get some tax collectors, or at least the rates we need to be taxing on.
myra:Alright, so the plan is to invite all of these lords and ladies here to establish their loyalties.
jay:I can guarantee you Lady Iredell will not be swearing any allegiance.
@main@:These are not mutually exclusive.  If she refuses to relent at the meeting, we'll mobilize, but we'll see how far we can get with a meeting first.
@main@:Cat, we're going to need riders to deliver invitations.  Jay, can you help Myra write an invitation?
jay:As you wish, milady.
@main@:I'll see if I can get some of the mages to write more copies when you're done.

earl:Well if it isn't the new Marchioness Blair.  My lady, I present to you a gift in hope our relationship will be long and prosperous.
@main@:Ah, a scroll?
earl:I heard you were a mage who values knowledge.  Hopefully we can move past Lord Cordiss and his untolerable rates?
@main@:Thank you.  I think you'll be pleased with what I have to say later.
countess:While I also detest that man's effect on my treasury, you are clearly not related to Marquess - ahem - John Blair.
@main@:I have the Empress' will behind me - what else do you need?
countess:...Very well.
 :In the background, a noblewoman glares at Jay.  By her demeanor, it must be none other than Countess Iredell.
@main@:Excuse me, but I must address all that are here.
earl:Of course, I look forward to listening.
 :@main@ lifts a spoon to her glass to get the present lords' attention.
@main@:Good lords and ladies of Thracia.  I'm sure news of my elevation was surprising to all of you, but the Empress' word is law, and we are all her subjects.
baron:I hear you're putting us under the dominion of Rehnquist now.  Is that true?
@main@:Yes.
 :There is some murmuring that quiets when @main@ begins to speak again.
@main@:I understand some of your misgivings about the so-called usurpation of Lord Cordiss' lands, but don't worry, you have much to gain from this.
baroness:But Rehnquist is an expansionist!  We can't afford another expansionary army, and besides, all of these new lands she's bringing into the Empire are overextending our reach!
vicount:Well I, for one, am glad someone in this Empire wants to restore our traditional lands.
@main@:Regardless, I think everyone will be glad to hear that your tax money will no longer subsidize Duke Cordiss' lavish parties.
 :A grumbling of content ripples through the diners.
@main@:And that I will charge only exactly what Imperial decree demands be paid to the Empress.
earl:Hear hear!
@main@:Those with vassals, I think it is only fair that you pass along some of your newfound savings as well.
countess:...As you wish.  I accept your generosity, milady.
iredell:Enough of this charade!
 :Countess Iredell angrily stands from her seat.
iredell:I'm disgusted that any of you are even considering this!  We all knew Marquess Blair in one form of another - and she is an imposter!
 :The seated lords are silent.
iredell:Mark my words @main@.  I will return, and next time, it will be with my army.
 :Iredell angrily leaves accompanies by her vassals.
earl:What are you going to do about this... unfortunate series of events Lady Blair?
@main@:You heard her.  She rejected our Empress' will.  I will say this - serve under me, and you will see your treasuries grow, but defy me, and, well, you will see what happends to Lady Iredell soon.
 :There is a moment of quiet.  Some of the lords even look a little scared.
earl:Ah, well, good that none of us here are opposed to you.  A toast to your health, and to Thracia's success.
lords:Long live Thracia!  Long live the Empire!  Long live Lady Blair!
