catelia:Hey Pleice.
pleice:Ah!
pleice:Oh it's just you Cat.  Sorry, I was...
catelia:Lost in thought?  I had a feeling.
pleice:Ha, I guess there wasn't much else I could be doing staring off into nothing.
catelia:Actually, I had a feeling you'd be a little down before I saw you.
pleice:Really?
catelia:Well, remember when we talked about going against our lords?
pleice:Oh yeah!  It's not exactly like we said -
catelia:Much less violent.
pleice:Exactly, but I think I know now what you felt back then now.
catelia:Hey it's not that bad.  You didn't even have to fight any of the Duchess' people!
pleice:I know, but we as an organization totally have, and I feel responsible for causing all of this turmoil in the Empire.  At least when Duke Cordiss attacked, we were acting in self defense.  Now, we're the agressors.
catelia:Come on though, in both instances, we've been totally justified.
pleice:Maybe...  I'm not used to having a part in events that are so... I guess status-quo disrupting.
catelia:Well, I'm the same way, but it feels good to be a force for actual change.
pleice:Yeah, but you didn't start out with the perspective I did.  My father taught me about the state of the lords and their struggles before he sent me off to The City.  The whims of nobles are very important to keep in mind when you have to maintain business relations with as many as possible.  I dunno... what he said felt like it would last forever - or at least longer than a few years!
catelia:I suppose I didn't know all about the politics of the House, but we won in the end!
pleice:Yeah, but our... electoral maneuvering somehow feels dirty, you know?  Like we cheated the system.
catelia:Please, all the nobles there are always making backroom deals.  It's how the system works.
pleice:Is it?  Was I just naive to think the House existed for civilized discourse between orators?
catelia:Well, I guess I don't know if that's how everything works, but judging on how the Duchess' lords flipped over to us, I'd say they mostly act in their own self-interest.
pleice:...Is it weird for me to say I feel kind of bad for Duchess Rehnquist?  She helped us, gave @main@ her title, and now we're here usurping her majority in the House.
catelia:I don't think it's that weird, but she's not exactly squeaky clean.  She makes no illusions about how she thinks we're all just pawns for her to get more power.
pleice:*sigh* You're right.
catelia:Better us then her, right?
pleice:I just wonder if she said those same words before coming into power.  She's got to think she's doing the right thing, right?  How else could she live with herself?
catelia:Well, she has said she wants to reclaim the lands that used to be a part of the Southern Empire to restore the glory of the Empire.
pleice:And she uses that to justify seizing more and more power for herself - the same way we justify doing it so we can stop the end of magic.
catelia:Ok, those aren't even comparable.  The magic stuff is existential.  We can live without the "glory of days past", but it's much harder to live without magic.
pleice:Sure...
pleice:I just hope we don't have do do any more of these drastic lines of actions.  We can't destroy the world in an effort to save it.
catelia:I understand.  I know @main@ can be a little gung ho about stuff like that, but when it comes down to it, sometimes people have to fight for what they believe in.  When they believe they can't succeed without us failing, the only thing we can do is stand up for ourselves and hope history sees it the same way.
pleice:I get that.  I just wish we could meet in the middle a little more.
catelia:Well, we already kind of do that within the Inquisition.
pleice:We do?
catelia:Yeah, well, specifically, you do.  You're always talking to us about how our actions might hurt the people we're trying to help.  You may not realize it, but I think the compromises you've made with @main@ have gotten this organization where it is today.
pleice:I'm flattered, but that almost makes us sound like enemies.
catelia:Ha!  I thought you wanted that line between friend and foe to break down.
pleice:It is a fine line...
