main:They're stalled!  Get back in formation!
main:Jay, is the formation set?
jay:Enough.  They're also trying to destroy our cannon with theirs on the wall.
main:I thought you said they weren't accurate?
jay:They're failing, but they'll hit eventually.
roxanne:Can't we use the cannon against their ambush force?
jay:They aren't accurate enough.  We'd have a lot of friendly fire when we engage!  We need to focus on taking out their artillery first or else we won't be able to seige them at all!
roxanne:That won't matter if they crush us here.  We aren't organized for a defense - there's no way we can stop their advance otherwise.
main:... We're going with Roxanne's plan.  Prepare for a lot of attrition.
jay:As you wish milady.  I'll limit how much we engage with to maximize our artillery's effectiveness and minimize friendly losses.
 :Jay orders the first line to meet the enemy forces still advancing and signals the artillery to fire as close to the enemy side as possible.
main:Fire!
 :The Inquisition forces slow down the incoming Blatchfordians as artillery fire consumes them all.  When the dust settles, the Blatchfordians are disorganized, but alive.  The Inquisition forces are all dead.
jay:Looks like the cannon was... effective.  Roxanne's plan worked... to an extent.  Our front line is totally lost though.
main:Stop the artillery and send our forces in - we can win now!
roxanne:Yes milady.  Told you it was necessary, Jay.
jay:...
 :The second and third lines advance on the battered Blatchfordians.
 :Slowly, the Blatchfordians begin to rout.  
 :The castle forces remain and continue to bombard the Inquisition cannon.
main:Jay, can we still seige the walls?
jay:...I'll make it work.
 :Under fire from castle defenses, the Inquisition forces reorient to face Blatchford Castle's walls.
 :Blatchford's artillery seems to be focused on trying to destroy the Inquisition's cannons, allowing the infantry and cavalry to enter formation without much incident.
main:So it's an artillery duel?
jay:Yes.  It's been theorized this is what warfare would be like against foes with cannon as well, but it hasn't happened much yet.
