main:Lord Blair!
blair:Grrr...
main:Order your men to stand down.  This battle is over.
 :Blair takes a glance behind him before making a mad dash away.
main:Oh no you don't!
 :@main@ tackles the lord to the ground.  After a swift punch to the gut, she places the tip of her staff to his neck.
main:Don't make this hard for yourself.
blair:Alright, I surrender, I surrender!
 :He waves to his nearby camp attendents, one of which leaves to grab a horn.  As it rings out, the noises of battle fade.

@main@:I can't believe we pulled through... 
catelia:Yeah, I didn't think we'd be able to repel a real army.
roxanne:Hardly an army - more of a show of force.
@main@:Well they succeeded on that front.
myra:I don't think he expected this much resistance, after all, Taney is gone now, and there are no more skeletons.
catelia:What did we do with Lord Blair by the way?
roxanne:He's currently resting securely with the other POWs in the dungeons.  Funny, they used to be his.
catelia:Prisoners Of War?  Do you still call them that when we aren't fighting a war?
roxanne:The term is convenient.
gabriella:Will Duke Grier come rescue him?  I hope we can get right with the Guild before he decides to come in force.
myra:I don't like our chances.  Duke Grier is good friends with Rutledge, so if the Duke wants his land back, I don't think our archmage will turn out to be too much of a believer in guild sovereignty.
@main@:Are we supposed to fight the entire Imperial Army next time?  Roxanne, surely Taney had a plan for this.
roxanne:Well, we had a skeleton army that deterred things like this, but I take it that that's off the table.
@main@:If only we could legitimately possess this land even if Duke Grier wants it from us.
gabriella:Buying the land is out of the option.  I mean, there's no way Marquess Blair would just give up his lands to us, even for money.
catelia:Never underestimate the greed of nobles.
roxanne:Well...
@main@:You have an idea?
roxanne:You told me Taney was trying to get Marquess Blair title, right?  How would that have worked?
myra:I'd imagine with Duke Grier out of the picture, Duchess Rehnquist would basically control all of the House of Lords, and then she'd be able to do whatever she wants.
@main@:Well, even with him still around, we're no friends of Duke Grier.  Maybe she'd be willing to back us in opposition to him.
roxanne:Precisely.
myra:The enemy of my enemy...
catelia:Ok sure, but how exactly do we, you know, ask?
gabriella:We'd have to get an audience with her court.  Actually, I think I've been to Duchess Rehnquist's court before... yeah, when I was a kid.  My father had some business with the Duchess.
roxanne:Ah, he's the head of the Merchant's Guild, right?
gabriella:Yep.
@main@:Do you think you could get us an audience?
gabriella:It shouldn't be that hard.  People go all the time to settle disputes and such.
roxanne:Sounds like it's settled.  The only question is who's going?  It's a few days on horseback to the capital.
@main@:Right, maybe just Gabby and I will go.  The rest of you can stay here and hold down the fort, so to speak.
catelia:We do need to repair the damage from the cannons...
myra:And there's still the issue of getting the former slaves settled on land near here.
gabriella:Right, then we'll see you all in a few days!

main:Hey Tamsin, I need provisions for a few days, Gabby and I are headed to the capital.
tamsin:As you wish.  I'll inform the cooks.
main:Actually, I wanted to ask you a personal question too.
tamsin:Ask away.
main:We just defended this castle from its rightful owner - your former boss.  Feel any, I don't know, conflicted feelings?
tamsin:Not really.
main:Oh?  That's great - I mean, for us.
tamsin:Lord Blair was never a great employer.  Privileged, overfed, and always mad at something.  It's satisfying to hear he has to live in his own dungeons.  He used to regale me with tales of him taunting his prisoners.
main:You want to turn the tables on him?  I don't think anyone would mind if he was as bad as you say.
tamsin:I would, but there'd be no satisfaction in it.  He probably doesn't even remember who I am.
main:Didn't you dress him every morning?  And handle most of his day to day tasks?
tamsin:Oh yes.  He found a way see right through the entire staff.  We were invisible to him.  Roxanne was really the one managing us.  Perhaps she'd find some satisfaction in seeing Blair's ironic situation.

 :Meanwhile
blair:Roxanne you traitor!
roxanne:Calm down John.  Just making sure you all are comfortable down here.
blair:You dare address me without my title?  I can't believe you're the same person who was my faithful servant all those years.
roxanne:Is that how you thought of me?  If it was, you had a pretty strange way of showing it.  I'll never understand what Jean saw in you.
blair:Don't speak her name!  It's your fault she was killed!
 :Roxanne glares at Blair.
roxanne:Always shifting the blame.  You told her to hold off Taney's forces while you escaped - which she did valiantly.
roxanne:I hope you enjoy your time here.
blair:Wait!
roxanne:This ought to be good.
blair:Surely there's a part of you still loyal to your lord?  I promise you your old position if you only release me now.
roxanne:You know, there's a reason almost none of us left with you.  You don't exactly command loyalty.  So, I think I'm going to have to pass on your generous offer.
blair:You'll pay for this!!!

secretary:We shall now hear from @main@ bearing news from Taney.
rehnquist:Excellent.  News regarding the city has been all too contradictory.  Rise and speak.
main:Your Grace, I am @main@.  I regret to inform you that Taney has died.
rehnquist:I suspected as such when I heard her army had disintegrated.  Hmm...
 :The Duchess looks at @main@, analyzing her demeanor
rehnquist:You bear the garb of the Mage's Guild, and yet you speak as though you were aligned with Taney.  Explain.
main:When we, ah, um, Mage's of the Guild, defeated Taney, we discovered her evidence of the coming end of magic and we also believe it will come to pass soon.  Has she told you about this before?
rehnquist:Yes.  Though as I understand it, her ideas were not popular among the rest of the Guild.  Has that changed?
main:Well, no.  However, we have maintained control over what forces she used to control, and are still trying to stop the death of magic.
rehnquist:I couldn't care less about that.  I know she failed to threaten the city enough for my forces to respond.  Now I'm down control over the city and the person who was going to be my new Marchioness Blair.
main:Well...
rehnquist:Speak.
main:I came here to request your sanction for our activities.  We've already been attacked by Duke Grier's forces led by Marquess Blair, and we know you are opposed to him.
 :Rehnquist looks closely at @main@, scrutinizing her intention.
rehnquist:@main@, was it?
main:Yes?
rehnquist:You are in charge of what was Taney's forces?
main:Um - yes!
rehnquist:Judging from the way you present yourself, you have little experience in court.  Am I right?
main:Yes... Your Grace.
rehnquist:What house are you from?
main:House?
rehnquist:Your house?  Your family?  Your surname?
main:I, um, don't have one.
 :Rehnquist looks surprised.
rehnquist:No name?  Yet you are a mage and leading a small army?
main:...Yes.  Is that a problem, Your Grace?
 :Rehnquist suddenly smiles deviously.
rehnquist:You know, I happen to be of need of a Marchioness Blair, and it sounds like you need a last name.
main:I don't quite follow...
rehnquist:My deal with Taney was for her to threaten the city.  In desperation, Grier would have to ask me for aid, I would take over his courts and "defeat" Taney.  In return for her aid, I would grant Taney Marquess Blair's old title.
rehnquist:It wouldn't have been a problem since I would have control over the House of Lords, but it seems like fate had something else in store.  Taney was to take control of Blair's old vassals, but I cannot force them to yield now without someone to take the title.
main:Wait, you want me to be a Marquess?
rehnquist:Not "a" Marquess.  Specifically Marchioness Blair.  Tell me, what happened to Blair after he attacked you.
main:We have him imprisoned in his own dungeon milady.
rehnquist:Most fortunate.  Marquess Blair has no castle and no lands - no legitimacy besides his blood.  I have control over enough of the House of Lords to give you official control over his old lands.
secretary:Milady, are you sure about this?  She's a nobody - a commoner!
rehnquist:True, but think how that will work for our advantage.  Taney was provably not a Blair, but @main@ here has no ties.  No ties whatsoever.  Your legitimacy will come through my decree.  Besides, we've already told the Empress we were going to appoint a new Marchioness Blair.
rehnquist:However, I will also require many things of you.  First, you must prove your loyalty to me.  Second, you must bring Blair's vassals under control, and third, you and Blair's vassals must vote with me in the House of Lords.
main:I - uh - this is a lot...
rehnquist:Can you do it?
main:Yes, Your Grace!
rehnquist:Excellent.  Protasekretis - what is currently our most pressing issue?
secretary:In the wake of Taney's lack of policing in Blair's lands, the forest east of the Mirran Plains has become a haven for bandits and other of their ilk.  There is a group of smugglers there undercutting Capital merchants.
rehnquist:Indeed.  @main@, clear out these ruffians to prove your loyalty to me.  If you can do this, I will give you Blair's title if you bring his vassals under my control.  As a Marchioness, you can seek whatever it is you want about the end of magic as long as you bring me my votes.
main:Thank you, your Grace.
rehnquist:David!
secretary:Your Grace?
rehnquist:Travel with them.  Make sure they're up to the task.
rehnquist:Oh, and bring Lord Blair with you when you return.  I'm sure we'll have lots to talk about.

catelia:How did it go?
main:Uh, better than expected.  Much better than expected.
myra:Come on, just say what happened.
main:Well, uh.
gabriella:Duchess Rehnquist offered @main@ the title of Marchioness!
catelia:So it worked!
main:Yeah, she basically handed it to me.
roxanne:She was already expecting to create a farce in the House of Lords.  I'm sure she doesn't really care if it was you or Taney.
myra:"Basically"?  What's the catch?
main:Well, we first have to prove our loyalty by taking out some bandits.  Then she'll have me ascend so I reclaim fealty from Blair's former vassals.  The ideas is that we have to vote with her in the House to secure her majority.
myra:That's a lot of catches.
gabriella:But, it's a clear path for some form of legitimacy.
catelia:Heh, we'll have to start calling you "Lady Blair" @main@!
main:Ugh, please don't.
roxanne:Back to the important business, who are these bandits we'll have to remove?  These military operations aren't cheap, you know.  If they're far away, supply costs are going to be untenable.
main:Uh, the Duchess said they were camped out in the forest east of the plains.
roxanne:Close enough then.  I think I remember their group - smugglers of the Exchange.  They hid out here on Blair's former lands away from the throne's control.  They would be a perfectly legal operation, but they refuse to pay Empire tariffs and refuse to work with the Merchant's Guild.
catelia:I always admired the fact that they just didn't want to enrich a bunch of guild fat cats, but they always have to cause more trouble after that.
gabriella:Hey, the guild provides an important collective bargaining mechanism.  If a lord demands a merchant's wares, we can boycott them.  It keeps them from abusing their power.  Of course, it doesn't work unless all merchants are a part of it, so the Exchange is an organization that actually hurts people in the big picture.
catelia:We?
myra:Right, we never mentioned Gabriella's father is Baron Duvall - the head of the Merchant's Guild.
catelia:Right, uh, no offense.
gabriella:None taken.  It is true that dues have been getting up there recently.
roxanne:Well, it's been a while, but we're once again the long arm of the law enforcing order on Blair territory.
main:Ha, I guess things are kind of full circle for you.
roxanne:Everything's different, but I suppose the title has remained.
roxanne:I'll begin organizing our forces, but this is going to put us relatively thin on funds.

 :A few days later
main:What do you make of it?
secretary:According to the messenger, they are not going to disperse quietly.  I think they're overselling their forces though.  They're a few simple buildings and anti-cavalry barriers.  Don't disappoint her Grace.
main:I'll do my best.  Luckily we have some of the Mage Guild's former finest.  Roxanne, can we clear those barriers for our cavalry?
roxanne:Yes, a few board control spells should do the trick.  I'll talk to Gabby and her mages about it.
main:Right.  I'll come in with Catelia and our foot soldiers afterwards.
myra:You should learn to ride @main@.  After all, every self-respecting noble rides into battle.
main:Ha, maybe after I'm a lady.  It can't be that different from riding an ox, right?
myra:What?
main:We used to saddle up the cattle on the farm for fun; our lord never gave us any horses to use.
myra:Now that's something I've got to see.
 :A mercenary hands @main@ a horn.
main:That was fast, Roxanne is one hell of an administrator.
 :@main@ blows a loud clear note and, at once, the sound of magical explosions thunder through the forest as the mages remove the cavalry barriers.
 :With a war cry, the horseback forces begin a charge with foot soldiers coming up behind them.
