roxanne:Welcome back @main@.  Were you successful?
@main@:Yes.  Very successful.
catelia:So the Inquisition resolution still stands?
@main@:Oh yeah.  Duchess Rehnquist thought she controlled everything in the House of Lords.  Well we sure showed her.
jay:Amazing.  I didn't think anyone could stop her takeover of the House of Lords, but, clearly, I was wrong.
myra:The plan seemed so far-fetched, and yet, here we are.
gabriella:I kind of feel bad that we had to go against her.  After all, she did so much for us.
@main@:I was going to say I feel the same, but then I remembered how much of a ruthless politician she is.
jay:You know...
@main@:Yes, Jay?
jay:With the 4 Thracian votes under your control, you are somewhat of a kingmaker now.
@main@:What do you mean?
jay:With the Grierian and Rehnquistian factions divided as they are, you can almost choose if any legislation passes since they both need your votes.
@main@:Huh.  I never thought about it like that.
roxanne:By policing the Rehnquistian faction's lands, we should be able to switch most of the empire's legal use of Illis over to the precharged variety.  However...
@main@:That's got to be enough.  Myra, what are the estimates?
myra:In theory, with all the magical devices in the empire using precharged Illis, field decay should go negative - i.e. the field should start getting stronger again.
roxanne:Yes.  In theory.  I think things may be very different in practice.
catelia:That's where I come in.  What's the issue?
roxanne:We're handling all of this on an enforcement basis.  Unless we can control the entire supply of Illis production, there will be great incentive for rogue mages to sell Illis they've charged.
catelia:We can deal with that.  If it becomes large enough to be a problem, we'll send the Inquisition to their doorstep.
roxanne:I don't doubt that, but who do you think is going to own that doorstep?
gabriella:The Merchant's Guild.
gabriella:That's it, isn't it?
jay:I don't see a problem.
gabriella:The problem is you want to go after my family.
jay:Isn't that good?  With your personal connection with Baron Duvall, we should be able to convince them to take action against merchants selling recharged Illis without a show of force.
gabriella:He'll never agree.  There's too much money to be made in charging Illis.
@main@:Never agree?  C'mon Gabby, you can convince him, right?
gabriella:I can try, but I'm telling you that where there's money to be made, he's all over it.  It doesn't matter what it is: Iliis, slaves, weapons, everything.
catelia:Then I guess we have no choice but to convince him with our army.
gabriella:No!  You can't!  I- I won't fight my own family.  Myra, you agree with me, right?
myra:Look, I know it's hard, but Roxanne is right.  We can't prevent the Death of Magic without the Merchant's Guild agreeing.
gabriella:Not you too!  Look, there are other ways.  The problem is all the raw Illis that's left over after use right?  We could enforce disposal afterwards throughout the Empire instead!
jay:Unrealistic.  We can't put a person in every household and next to every magic device.
catelia:Yeah, we're more suited to going after singular bad actors.
gabriella:Fine, then uhhh, uuhhh... We could reward people for turning in their old Illis, wait, nevermind.  Wait!  We could -
@main@:Listen Gabby, the only other solutions are going to involve large amounts of manpower or money we don't have.
gabriella:I can't let you just sit here and talk about how you are going to specifically depose my father.
catelia:You don't have to go with us, you know?  We can take care of it.
gabriella:That's just as bad.
jay:From what you've told us about him, your father doesn't sound like a very good man.  Personally, I think the Merchant's Guild is a corrupt institution that -
gabriella:Oh just shut up!  I know my father does some things that are bad, but he was - is - a good father to me!  I will not support any action we take if it is going to involve hurting my father.
roxanne:Well we don't have to kill him -
gabriella:Like we didn't "have to" kill Lady Ellsworth?  I know he'll fight for the Guild's independence to his last breath.
 :Gabriella begins to tear up.
@main@:Gabby...
gabriella:I've heard enough.  I'm leaving.
@main@:To where?
gabriella:To my family.  Look, I'll try and convince my father to accept your demands, but I will not fight against him.
 :Gabriella leaves sullenly.
 :A silence falls over the room.
@main@:How about this.  We'll try negotiation first.  We can arrange a meeting with the Guild, and make our case even if Gabby can't convince him.
roxanne:Very well.  I will send a courier to request an audience.
