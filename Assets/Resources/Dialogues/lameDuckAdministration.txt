catelia:Is it over?	
pleice:Yeah...
myra:Not yet.
main:But Atheria's dead.  What else is there to do?
myra:She may be dead, but we still have to stop all the things in here that are channelling mana.  If she brought the end of magic 2 years closer, there's probably a lot of magic being used around here.
catelia:I only caught a little bit of your conversation.  What's going on?
pleice:Well, essentially, Atheria is also worried about the end of magic.
catelia:Then why did you kill her?
main:Yeah, but instead of doing things literally any other way, she decided to invade the city with her skeleton army to control the use of magic.
catelia:Right.  Now what?
myra:Well, she used so much mana trying to limit the use of mana that we only have until the end of the year before magic is gone for good.
main:Let's see if we can't get her army to stand down.  Who's even puppeteering all of these skeletons?
 :Suddenly, the door to the warroom bursts open.
