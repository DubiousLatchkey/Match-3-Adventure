pleice:You didn't kill them, did you?
main:Nah, just knocked'em out.  Besides, how would I explain that to Myra?  "Sorry I blew up the guild building, also, I killed some Exchange guy after not getting membership".
pleice:Yeah, we're not even in a guild protected part of the city.

catelia:My name is Catelia.  I lead the neighborhood watch.
main:Really?  I thought the Exchange kept order around this part of town.
|setExpression catelia Pained
catelia:*sigh* They do, but we keep them from harassing the citizens too much.
|setExpression catelia Normal
 :@main@ looks at the unconscious body on the ground.
main:Thanks, but I think you might be a little late to the party.
catelia:So it seems.  Unfortunately, we don't have enough people to maintain order around here.  I'm the only one who does this full time.  Everyone else just patrols during their free time.
catelia:I'll take care of this one.
 :She gestures to the would-be thief
|setExpression pleice Question1
pleice:"Take care"?  That's... ominious.
|setExpression catelia Serious
catelia:I'm just going to ask them a few questions.  Attacking 2 Mage Guild apprentices?  The Exchange is getting bold - and that doesn't bode well for me.
pleice:"Ask them a few questions"?  Can't you just give them to the city guard?
|setExpression pleice Normal
main:I'll bet those guys are all paid off by the Exchange.
catelia:She's right.  The guard captain for this district gets "donations" to turn a blind eye to Exchange business.  Now it's up to the people to fend for ourselves.
catelia:Listen, we need to deal with the Exchange sooner or later, or else whatever's got them so excited is going to affect more than just my district.  You two were attacked by this thief; Isn't that enough grounds for the Mage's Guild to intervene or at least help?
pleice:Not really, we were out of their territory and we're not even full members.
 :Catelia looks disappointed
main:But... I mean, we're here, right?  We can't really act on behalf of the guild, but we can as individuals.
catelia:Look, if you want to help, come to my house tonight - we're having a watch meeting.  I'm right next to the smith's.
|exit catelia right
pleice:Well, seeing as you aren't becoming a guild member for a while, I guess we have some free time.
main:No need to rub it in.  I would have helped even if I passed, I mean, I could act with the authority of the guild too in that case.  But first-

catelia:Alright, now that everyone's here, we can get started.
catelia:Oh yes, the newcomers are Mage's Guild apprentices I met on patrol today.  Would you two care to introduce yourselves?
main:I'm @main@, and this is my friend-
pleice:Pleice
main:We got attacked by an Exchange thief today.  I hear that that isn't good news for the city.
catelia:Yes.  But we aren't just going to take this lying down.  I have a plan.
watchman:Hang on, does this mean we have guild support now?
catelia:Unfortunately no, but with the help of these two, we may be able to get these gangsters out.
|setExpression main Shocked
main:Wait, go on the offensive?
|setExpression main Normal
catelia:We've been playing defense for too long, managing sympotoms.  Unless we take down the Exchange at the source, that's all we'll ever do - and we're losing.
pleice:But aren't they a whole organization?  We're just a few people!
catelia:All we need to do is break their bureaucracy, cut off the head of the serpent.  Once Captain Cordiss stops getting those "donations", they'll crack down on the lower level guys.
|setExpression main Question1
main:Yeah, but won't they reorganize?
|setExpression main Normal
catelia:We might need to have a... talk with the good captain.
watchman:We've thought about this for a while.
main:Alright then.  What do you need us to do?
catelia:We can hit them at the docks tonight.  From what I've been able to gather, they're arranging a sale of their *ahem* "acquired" Illis powder.  It's a big shipment, so the Exchange brass should be there.
pleice:So that's why they wanted our magical artifacts.
watchman:Wait, what's Illis powder?
pleice:Illis crystals are used to craft magical amplifiers like @main@'s staff.
catelia:Yeah, this room is technically being lit by an Illis light.
watchman:No, I got that, but you said powder?
main:Yeah, when they they steal people's equipment, the crystals are built into them, so they crush and grind everything down for easy transport.  It can be reforged later.
|setExpression main Shocked
main:That's must be why they're starting to target the Mage's Guild - they're expanding their business!
|setExpression main Normal
|setExpression catelia Serious
catelia:Exactly.  Let's go interrupt their party, shall we?
pleice:Wait!  We don't have our guild patrol gear, we'd have to get our weapons first.
catelia:Here, take these.

 :The thief looks to the shadows behind them where another figure gives a nod.
