 :The mages present at their desks turn to face @main@.

oleron:@main@, you stand before this council today to requesting full Mage Guild membership.  Guild membership is not something we take lightly; as a mage of our order, your actions would reflect on this council as well as the rest of the guild.
myra:Yes, yes Archmage.  As @main@'s mentor, I can assure you that she is well aware of the responsibilities membership brings.
oleron:Very well Myra.  @main@, Myra has vouched for your magical abilities since your apprenticeship began, but the council still requires a test before we can allow you to join us.
myra:Call it a formality.
oleron:Formality or not, the test is a tradition - one every one of us has taken, and one that each prospective mage will for a very long time yet.
oleron:But I digress.  @main@, are you ready?
main:As ready as I'll ever be.
myra:Have a little more confidence!
myra:So, the test is a simple one - break this barrier.  This is a test of problem solving as much as it is one of your magical abilities.
 :A wall of light springs to life in the center of the testing hall.
oleron:I've not gotten the opportunity to see you at work @main@.  I'm looking forward to seeing your thought process.
main:Breathe in, and... out
