main:This is a sample piece of dialogue.  This line is short and will fit in one textbox.
pleice:This is another sample piece of dialogue.  This line is long and will have to be fit onto multiple textboxes.  Therefore, the system needs to figure out how to automatically kern between 2 textboxes and break the lines accordingly.  I think it will either check against some sort of character count and then go back to the last word or just crop to the nearest sentence.  Both seem ok, so I'll need to to more research to see what looks nice.

pleice:Lol I moved to near where you were.  I'm also going to say some more things so it's easier to test this behavior with click interruption.
main:Aaaand, when you move to this line of text, the move continues, because there is a time in lines of 2.
pleice:Only when you see this text does the animation snap to the finished position.
pleice:Anyway, I'm going to exit the scene now
