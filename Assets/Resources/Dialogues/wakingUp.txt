pleice:I'm just glad you're ok.  That explosion was huge!
|setExpression main Question1
|setExpression pleice Normal
main:Explosion?
 :Pleice and Myra look at each other.
|setExpression pleice Question1
pleice:The explosion you caused in the testing hall?
|setExpression pleice Normal
main:I have no idea what you're talking about.
myra:Tell me what you remember.
|setExpression main Normal
main:I was... I was trying to break that barrier by overwhelming it, and then... um...
|setExpression main Question1
main:There was a light? I...I was somewhere else.
|setExpression main Normal
myra:Right, that light you saw was the barrier collapsing and, well, exploding.
main:You look fine though.
myra:The council is always shielded during magical tests in case something like this happens, but I don't think anyone expected this kind of damage.
main:I do feel better at chanelling mana.

 :Spells can be cast on your turn by paying their mana cost.
|setExpression main Question1
main:Wait, "this kind of damage"?  What happened to the testing hall? I didn't destroy it, did I?
myra:Afraid so.  Your spell blew the side of the building out.  It's still standing, but no one is going to be using the hall for a while.  Or the adjacent rooms for that matter.
pleice:Hey, look on the bright side!  At least no one was hurt!  It's usually pretty sparse this time of day anyways.
|setExpression main Pout
main:Except me.
|setExpression main Normal
pleice:Yeah... Except you don't look burned or anything - you or your clothes
myra:The physician said you didn't have any shrapnel wounds either.  Did you shield yourself in time?
main:No I... It was like I wasn't even there.  It was still the Mage Guild, but everything was... different.
|setExpression myra Serious
pleice:Different how?
main:Everything was destroyed, basically rubble.
|setExpression pleice Question1
pleice:You... had a dream?
main:No.  It was so real.  I met someone, they mentioned raiders and booked it.  Those raiders, they found me and...
 :@main@ rubs the sore spot on her head
main:Yeah!  I was hit right here!  I woke up right after that.
|setExpression pleice Normal
|setExpression myra Question1
myra:What are you trying to say?  That you had a vision of some sort?
|setExpression myra Normal
|setExpression main Question1
main:I guess?  It was so much more than just seeing though.  It was like I was there, just after an apocolyptic event happened.
|setExpression main Normal
pleice:Wow.
main:We'll talk about it later.
 :@main@ stretches her arms out
main:I feel like I've been lying down for a while.   How long was I out?
myra:A few hours.  You look all better now though.
|setExpression main Normal
main:I guess I am.  I don't feel hurt anywhere.  Even my head seems fine now.
pleice:You mean like it was hurt in a vision and you weren't actually hurt?
|setExpression main Serious
main:Yeah...
|setExpression main Normal
myra:Let's hope things go more smoothly next time.
|setExpression main Shocked
main:Next time?  You mean I failed?
myra:Unfortunately, though you did technically obliterate the barrier, the Archmage believes that accidentally destroying the testing hall demonstrated *ahem* "A level of magical control unsuitable for guild membership".
|setExpression main Serious
main:Heh, sorry about that.
|setExpression main Normal
myra:Don't worry.  The Archmage isn't too mad all things considered.  You have, after all, proven your magical strength at least.  The council is willing to give you another test during the next exam period.
main:Which is...
plaice:In about six months.
|setExpression main Shocked
main:Six months!?  Dang.
|setExpression main Normal
myra:Yeah, the schedule is pretty set in stone already, but hey, it's not like we have the facilities to test you again right now.
main:...Right.
myra:Relax, we'll talk more about what we'll do for the next six months tomorrow.  In the meantime, what you said about your vision has me intrigued.  I'm going to do some research.

main:Now what?
pleice:Well, I did order a cake to celebrate your acceptance, but...

pleice:I guess so.
